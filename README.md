# 3D White Cursors

This is a reimplementation of the classic 3D-White cursors known from Windows 95 and onwards. This reimplementation features many new cursors inspired from the old design to offer a complete set of cursors for use under Linux/X11.

The build script is based on the work done for the [Numix Cursor Theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-cursor-theme).

### Installing

I still have to figure out how to offer a package as built via GitHub.

### Building

Building the cursors needs Inkscape and xcursorgen. With those prerequisites installed you can just run the build script. It will generate a tarball that can be installed using for example KDEs mouse cursor settings panel.

Enjoy!
